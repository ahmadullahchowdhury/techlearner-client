This this a Fullstack project on hosted on Firebase. This is a single page application which has many router. By using node and express, I made an API, which hosted on Vercel and used in this project.  


The main specialty of this project is that,  It has private route so that no one can go to Checkout route without login. Beside that, there is theme switch toggle by which user can switch between dark and light theme.
